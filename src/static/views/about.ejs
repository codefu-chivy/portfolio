        <p><span id="bio"><span class="inner-bio">let Chival_Bio = new Bio("</span>I'm Chival, a fresh full stack developer based in New York. After graduating from university, 
        I developed a passion for web development and began learning as much as I could. From HTML and CSS to all things Javascript, I was determined to pave my way to a new career. It's never too late to start doing what you love.
        Currently, my go-to tech stack is MongoDB, Express/Node, and React, and I'm excited to learn other technologies in my journey. In my spare time you can find me jamming on the piano and bass.<span class="inner-bio">");</span></span></p>
